    <p>The core justification for Ajax style programming is to overcome the page loading requirements of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" title="HTML">HTML</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP" title="HTTP">HTTP</a>-mediated web pages. Ajax creates the necessary initial conditions for the evolution of complex, intuitive, dynamic, data-centric user interfaces in web pages-the realization of that goal is still a work in progress.</p>
    <p>Web pages, unlike native applications, are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling" title="Loose coupling">loosely coupled</a>, meaning that the data they display are not tightly bound to data sources and must be first <i>marshalled</i> (set out in proper order) into an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" title="HTML">HTML</a> page format before they can be presented to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent" title="User agent">user agent</a> on the client machine. For this reason, web pages have to be re-loaded each time a user needs to view different datasets. By using the XMLHttpRequest object to request and return data without a re-load, a programmer by-passes this requirement and makes the loosely coupled web page behave much like a tightly coupled application, but with a more variable lag time for the data to pass through a longer "wire" to the remote web browser.</p>
