VERSION: 1.02
DATE: 1/29/2009
ACTIONSCRIPT VERSION: 3.0 (AS2 version is also available)
UPDATES & MORE DETAILED DOCUMENTATION AT: http://www.TweenMax.com
DESCRIPTION:
	Normally, all transformations (scale, rotation, and position) are based on the DisplayObject's registration
	point (most often its upper left corner), but TransformAroundCenter allows you to make the transformations
	occur around the DisplayObject's center. 
	
	If you define an x or y value in the transformAroundCenter object, it will correspond to the center which 
	makes it easy to position (as opposed to having to figure out where the original registration point 
	should tween to). If you prefer to define the x/y in relation to the original registration point, do so outside 
	the transformAroundCenter object, like :
	TweenLite.to(mc, 3, {x:50, y:40, transformAroundCenter:{point:new Point(200, 300), scale:0.5, rotation:30}});
	
	TransformAroundCenterPlugin is a Club GreenSock membership benefit. You must have a valid membership to use this class
	without violating the terms of use. Visit http://blog.greensock.com/club/ to sign up or get more details.
	
USAGE:
	import gs.*;
	import gs.plugins.*;
	TweenPlugin.activate([TransformAroundCenterPlugin]); //only do this once in your SWF to activate the plugin
	
	TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {transformAroundCenter:{scale:1.5, rotation:150}});
